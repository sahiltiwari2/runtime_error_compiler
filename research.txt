Based on the search results provided, here are the key tools you can use to create a web compiler:

1. **JDoodle Compiler**: The GeeksforGeeks article [1] explains how to embed a JDoodle compiler into a website. This allows you to write code in various languages like C, C++, Java, etc. and run it directly on your website.

2. **Compiler Construction Tools**: The GeeksforGeeks article [2] discusses various compiler construction tools that can be used to build a web compiler, including:
   - Parser Generators: Tools like PIC and EQM that generate syntax analyzers (parsers) from a grammatical description of the language.
   - Scanner Generators: Tools like Lex that generate lexical analyzers from regular expression descriptions.
   - Syntax-Directed Translation Engines: Tools that generate intermediate code from a parse tree.
   - Automatic Code Generators: Tools that generate machine language code from an intermediate representation.

3. **Web Compiler Visual Studio Extension**: The Visual Studio Marketplace article [3] describes the "Web Compiler" extension, which allows you to compile LESS, Sass, JSX, ES6, and CoffeeScript files directly within Visual Studio.

4. **Online Compiler Tools**: The Hackernoon article [4] mentions several free online compiler tools like OnlineGDB, which support a wide range of programming languages and can be embedded into websites.

5. **Compiler Toolchain Optimization**: The Dropbox article [5] discusses optimizing the compiler toolchain, system libraries, and other low-level components to improve the performance and throughput of web servers, which is also applicable to building a high-performance web compiler.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, you can create a robust and scalable web compiler capable of handling high traffic loads.

One of the code compilation tools that can be implemented in a web environment is a Parser Generator. Parser generators are tools that produce 
syntax analyzers (parsers) based on a grammatical description of a language. These tools are essential for the syntax analysis phase of compilation,
 which is complex and time-consuming. Examples of parser generators include PIC and EQM, which can be utilized to generate parsers for various 
 programming languages in a web compiler environment
